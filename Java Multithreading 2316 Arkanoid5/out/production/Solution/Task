2413 Arkanoid 5
What else is missing from the Arkanoid class?
First, he needs the run () method, which will describe the main logic of the program.
We also need the move () method - which will move all objects requiring movement by one step.
Create the run () and move () methods.
We also need a NOT private static variable game of type Arkanoid, which will store a link to the created instance of the Arkanoid class.
It should look something like this:
static Arkanoid game;

Requirements:
1. In the Arkanoid class, the void run () method must be created without parameters.
2. In the Arkanoid class, the void move () method must be created without parameters.
3. The run method must be accessible from outside the Arkanoid class.
4. The move method must be accessible from outside the Arkanoid class.
5. A non-private static game field of type Arkanoid must be created in the Arkanoid class.
